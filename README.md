Map Tour
========

A storytelling template combining an interactive map, a photo and text panel, and a thumbnail carousel.

This is a new version of the popular map tour template that has been rewritten to provide a better experience on smartphone, see [what's new](#whats-new).

The template is now available in two versions:
 * An hosted version in ArcGIS Online that provide an interactive builder tool
 * A downloadable version that you can deploy on your web server and enhance to fit your needs

To use this template on ArcGIS Online you need to be a member of an Organization and have Publisher or Administrator access. The template can be accessed from the ArcGIS Online's map viewer Share dialog.

## How to configure and deploy a Map Tour

Download the [User Download archive](https://github.com/Esri/map-tour-storytelling-template-js/raw/master/map-tour/Storytelling-MapTour-1 0.zip), it contains the following files:

| File                	                     | Contains                                                              |

| resources/                                 | Resources (markers, icons, translation)                               |
| **samples/**      			                  | Sample data layer to create your webmap                               |
| **index.html**         		               | Application html file (to be edited with web map id)                   |
| **Readme.pdf**       		                  | Detailed readme guide                                                 |

A typical Map Tour configuration involves the following steps:
 * Create a web map that fits your need (basemap, eventual additional context layers like the path of your tour, etc.)
 * Import your data:
   - Your data can be stored in **Feature Layer**, **CSV**, **Shapefile** or **Map Service**, see **samples** for ready to use layer
   - Mandatory attributes for each feature are: **name, description, picture and thumbnail URL**
   - Feature can also have an optional color, otherwise the default is red. 4 icons set are provided: **red/blue/green and purple** (the respective expected data values are r, b, g, p)
 * Center the web map to the initial extent you want for the tour
 * **Save and share the web map publicly**
 * Open **index.html** with a text file editor
 * Locate the configuration section at the beginning of the file
 * Edit the line **webmap:""** to **include your web map id** between the quotes
 * Optionally remove samples folder and Readme.pdf
 * Copy files to your web server root or in a specific folder

## FAQ

### Is the template compatible with previous version?
Yes, web map designed for the previous version should continue to work without any modification. Customization and enhancement of the application will require code changes, most of them should be easy to translate into the new application.

### What's new?

#### Map Tour 1.0.1 released on 13/04/26
 * Responsive web design that offer a new user experience on Smartphone
 * Localized in 20 languages: Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French, English, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.
 * Support of Feature Service
 * New layout option: picture float on the right of the map
 * The thumbnail carousel is more interactive (support touch on tablet device, support scrolling on desktop)

### Which web map layer will be used?
The application will use the web map **upper visible point feature layer**. 

Eligible feature layer are:
 - Feature service with two attachments per feature (main picture has first attachment, thumbnail as the second)
 - Feature layer without attachments
 - Web map embedded data: CSV, Shapefile
 - Map service: specific layer only (e.g. MyService/MapServer/0)

If that doesn't match your web map structure, look for the configuration property named **sourceLayerTitle** in index.html and set it to the title of your web map layer.

### How should my fields be named?

Here is the valid option for each field:

| Data             		                                    | Valid names (case insensitive)             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------	| -----------------------------------------	|
| Name      				                                    | name, title, name-short, name-long 	      |
| description         	                                    | caption, description, snippet, comment 	   |
| Picture (optional for Feature service with attachments) 	| pic_url, pic, picture, url                 |
| Thumbnail (optional for Feature service with attachments)	| thumb_url, thumb, thumbnail                |
| Color (optional)                                          | icon_color, color, style                   |

If that doesn't match your data, you can change that configuration in **app/maptour-config.js** 

### What are the configuration settings?

Configuration happens in two files:
 * index.html
  - Web map id
  - Application layout
  - Use the first data record as an introduction slide
  - Header title/subtitle (webmap title/subtitle used by default)
  - Force webmap layer to be used
  - Optional zoom level to be applied for the story points following introduction
  - Bing map key
  - Proxy URL
  - Portal URL
  - Geometry service URL
 * app/maptour-config.js
  - Header, picture panel and carousel colors
  - Header logo image and link
  - Header "A story map" title and link
  - Marker sets  
  - Data fields name

### Can I enhance the application?
Yes, most of the look and feel customization can be done using the user download and including the css/html override directly into index.html. We know that this can be hard, so here are some examples of customization:

If you want to change the behavior of one functionality or want to add new one, you will need to read the developer guide below.

## Developer guide

This developer guide is intended to developer that wants to modify behavior or add new functionalities to the Map Tour application. If you only need to customize look and feel of the Map Tour, you should be able to do so using the User download.
It requires basic knowledge of HTML, Javascript and CSS languages.

### Introduction

To build a production version of the application from the source code, you need:
 * a Windows OS 
 * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
 * [Java Runtime version 6 or higher](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html)

The build script use [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) to optimize the application Javascript and [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) and [YUI Compressor](http://yui.github.com/yuicompressor/) for external dependencies.
The script will be ported to a full node.js later on. 

### Design
Map Tour relies on AMD and Dojo loader [AMD](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/jshelp/#inside_dojo_amd) for application structure.

The application is structured as this:

| Path          			                  | Contains						|
| -------------------------------------	|  ----------------------------------------------------	|
| app      				                     | Package structured Javascript and CSS source code 	|
| app/maptour-config.js			            | Configuration file (loaded at execution time) 	|
| app/storymaps/maptour/core/		         | Core modules (main module is Core.js) 		|
| app/storymaps/maptour/ui/ 		         | UI components grouped by target device 		|
| app/storymaps/maptour/builder/	         | UI components of the builder mode 			|
| app/storymaps/maptour/BuildConfig.js 	| Require.js build configuration file			|
| app/storymaps/ui/ 			               | UI components not specific to the application 	|
| app/storymaps/utils/ 			            | Utility modules not specific to the application 	|
| lib/ 					                     | External dependencies 				|
| resources/nls/                  			| Externalized text strings of the application  	|
| resources/markers/ 			            | The 4 colors set of map marker 			|
| resources/icons/ 			               | Icons 						|

The main dependencies are:
 * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
 * [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
 * [iScroll](http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4)
 * [SwipeView](http://cubiq.org/swipeview)

### How to use the application from the source code
 * Make accessible the src folder to your web server
 * Edit index.html to the web map you want to use

### How to build application from the source code
  * Open a terminal and navigate to the tools folder 
  * Run the following command:

        build.bat

The deploy folder now contains the built application that you can deploy to your web server.
